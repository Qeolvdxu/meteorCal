MeteorSim calculates user data for Meteors falling towards a planets surface. 
The data output will be located in the same directory as the executable as output.txt


To implement:
Add option for diameter of the meteor
Calculate the correct distance after impact due to with resistance
Create better visuals
calculate the crater of the meteor
Implement the angle of the meteor
Account for the atmosphere reducing the mass and diameter of the meteor
Collect density information
Allow user to enter diameter, density, and angle
